# Lorenz-96-hybrid-esn

### State Estimation of the Multi-Scale Lorenz 96 System Using a Hybrid Echo State Network and Ensemble Kalman Filter

This is a research project completed for capstone modeling course AM170B, supervised by professor Ashesh Chattopadhyay.

## Sample output for ESN model

This repository contains attempted approach on state estimation using our knowledge on Hybrid ESNs (Echo State Networks) and EnKF (Ensemble Kalman Filtering). We train model on noisy samples of the Multiscale Lorenz 96 system, generated by applying a Gaussian noise on the RK4 solver. 

The repository contains plenty scripts to help with our project:
- `data.ipynb`, a data generation script
- `enkf.ipynb`, a sample run of an Ensemble Kalman Filter
- `hybrid_rcesn.ipynb` and `new_hybrid_rcesn.ipynb`, iterations of our Hybrid Echo State Network
- `main.ipynb`, containing all the steps, tests run, and performance metrics described in our paper.
- `report.pdf`, the official report for the paper
- `final_slides.pdf`, cumulative slides describing our efforts
