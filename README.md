# Lorenz-96-hybrid-esn

State Estimation of the Multi-Scale Lorenz 96 System Using a Hybrid Echo State Network and Ensemble Kalman Filter

This is an attempted approach on state estimation using our knowledge on Hybrid ESNs (Echo State Networks) and EnKF (Ensemble Kalman Filtering). We will train and test our model on noisy samples of the Multiscale Lorenz 96 system. This is a research project completed for our capstone modeling course AM170b.
